# Monte Carlo simulation and Geometric Brownian Motion for Simulating Stock price dynamics

## Setup:
* Import necessary packages (see requirements file).
* Define the security for which you would like to simulate price dynamics for. 
* Choose the time frame from which you will train and test the Monte Carlo Simulation model.
* Download you data using the yf.download() function.
* specify the Adj Close column to account for an income accrual events in the price of the security (dividends, short term and long term capital gains, corp actions, etc.). 

## Setting up your simulation parameters
